The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) addresses the prevalence of misleading information online through the development of technical standards for certifying the source and history (or provenance) of media content. C2PA is a Joint Development Foundation project, formed through an alliance between Adobe, Arm, Intel, Microsoft and Truepic.

C2PA unifies the efforts of the Adobe-led [Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)](https://contentauthenticity.org/) which focuses on systems to provide context and history for digital media, and [Project Origin](https://www.originproject.info/), a Microsoft- and BBC-led initiative that tackles disinformation in the digital news ecosystem.

## Specification

The C2PA Specification along with a series of companion documents can be found [here](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/index.html). That site offers a "Downloads" menu where PDF versions of each of the documents can be obtained.

Feedback on the specification can be provided [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevOsvZKHIc_4Dljk7IkoW37mcuItUEV3I6hoUZhR2suxRVPg/viewform?usp=sf_link) or directly in our [github issues](https://github.com/c2pa-org/specifications/issues).

## Introduction Video
